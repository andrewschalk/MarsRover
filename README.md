This is group 1's report for the Mars Rover project for MRE320, spring semester 2024 at SIUE with Dr. Zhang. Group 1 consists of Cheng Chen, Liam McGuire, and Andrew Schalk. This report details our assembly and mission testing of the SIUE mars rover educational kit. Tasked with assembling the rover and sending it on a pre-set mission we present our mission results. The mission data was compiled and presented to the class. Details on our findings can be seen in our [presentation](/Mars Rover Presentation.pdf)
